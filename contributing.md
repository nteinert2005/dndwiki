# Contributing to DND Wiki

## How do I contribute?

### Improve documation
As a part of the DND community, you're the perfect use case for this application. Grammar, typo correction, better examples, etc. All of these things and extras are welcome and will be considered. 

### Add new features
Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. Help make them easier to resolve. Handling issues takes a lot of time that we could rather spend on fixing bugs and adding features.

## Submit An Issue
When requesting new features or submitting an issue, please use the following labels to help make this platform better:
* [`feature` issues](https://github.com/nteinert2005/dndwiki/labels/feature) are things that may be included
